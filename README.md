Tank Battler

This is basically a featureless MechaBellum clone. Right now, you can buy/place tanks and unlock the flanks. You can't upgrade units, and there are no special effects to buy (like missiles or napalm, etc).

It's not balanced very well yet, but there are a lot of strategy options with what little we have. If you want to win ***every single time*** against the bot, just put a few cannons next to your castle on the first round, and then spend every other round putting chainguns in the far corner behind the bot base. If you start to lose, put a few more canons next to your base to slow them down. You can win the base race.

Multiplayer is WIP.

For devs: it's set up so that it would be pretty easy to add more tanks. Just modify the sprite sheet and the unit dictionary. Instructions are in the unit class file.

To play the game, put all the files in one folder and run Batfield.py. If you just want to watch tanks fight, bfield_idle_demo.py is for that.
