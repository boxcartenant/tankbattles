Tank Battler

Right now, all that's done is the unit object and 5 unit types, with a simple AI that follows and targets the nearest enemy until dead. The game just generates two teams and sends them to fight one another. When one team is dead, it declares the winner and then shows a gray rectangle on the top left of the window.

Clicking the gray rectangle on the top left after a battle will restart the board.

The roadmap for this project is to make it turn-based, add a couple of towers, and add buttons and economic features for the player to buy tanks &c, just like in MechaBellum.

When the low-res MB clone is complete, the foundations for this code will be repurposed for another project I'm working on, which will be nothing like MB, but it will need this kind of feature-set to work.
