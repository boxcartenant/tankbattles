Tank Battler

This is basically a featureless MechaBellum clone. Right now, you can buy/place tanks and unlock the flanks. You can't upgrade units, and there are no special effects to buy (like missiles or napalm, etc).

It's not really balanced well, but there are some interesting effects to specializing in one kind of tank. For example, if you only spend all your money on shotguns, you'll have an extremely strong early game, but that will drop off much later. I'd capitalize on that and just increase the player health to make the games longer and defeat that kind of strategy, but the game starts to lag in a big way when there are too many tanks. So, optimization is on the agenda.

Right now, it's set up so that it would be pretty easy to add more tanks. Just modify the sprite sheet and the unit dictionary. Instructions are in the unit class file.

I'm 50/50 on if I'm going to keep developing this. I might add multiplayer later, or balance it a little more for fun, or maybe add more features or improve the AI. But as it is, I've accomplished what I set out to do: the basic foundations of this game are going to be repurposed for another project.
